Education:

I studied Computer Science and Engineering at the German University in Cairo, where I focused on software development, AI, embedded systems and more. My graduation project used deep learning for breast cancer diagnosis and ran on a Raspberry Pi.
Worked on 40+ projects throughout my time in college from mini projects to large-scale systems including web apps, Unity games, embedded systems and more. Built a breast cancer diagnosis system using ResNet-101 and InceptionV3, deployed it on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a working GUI. Scored an A+ on the project. Also joined the IEEE Machine Learning Club and worked on applying deep learning to practical problems.
