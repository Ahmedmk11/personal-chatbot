Skills and Tech Stacks:

I mainly work with React, Node.js, Express, and Vite, using both SQL and NoSQL databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and Firestore.
I’ve built e-commerce sites, payment integrations, KYC systems, and internal tools like task managers and face recognition apps.
I’ve led teams and managed technical partnerships.
For UI, I use Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Bootstrap, and Ant Design.
I also use Python for automation, AI and backend tasks.
