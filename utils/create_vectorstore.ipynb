I also have practical experience with computer vision and AI through my Raspberry Pi-based deep learning bachelor project. My main technical skills include React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, NestJS, Python, MySQL, MongoDB, and REST APIs.\\n\\nWork Experience\\nAt Sweep Resort in Charlotte, USA, I worked as a Lead Full-Stack Software Engineer from February 2024 to July 2025. I led a small team to build the Sweep Resort website using ReactJS, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. My work improved responsiveness, automated workflows, and cut deposit handling time by half. I integrated payment processors, cryptocurrency gateways, and KYC systems, enabling secure transactions for over 6,500 users while ensuring regulatory compliance. I also collaborated with external partners to implement more than six API integrations, including webhooks, callbacks, and custom authentication mechanisms. Additionally, I automated internal tasks with Python and Stripe webhooks, reducing manual logging by 99.5 percent and saving the team approximately five to six hours per day.\\n\\nI completed an internship as a Full-Stack Web Developer at Xceed in Cairo from August 2023 to September 2023. During this time, I built a task management system using ReactJS, Vite, Firebase, and SCSS, which improved team coordination and reduced task tracking time. I also developed a face-recognition attendance tool using ReactJS, Flask, MySQL, and Bootstrap to enable remote check-ins.\\n\\nAs a freelancer, I worked for Splash in Cairo from January 2023 to May 2023, developing an e-commerce website using ReactJS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.\\n\\nEducation\\nI earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from the German University in Cairo, completing my studies in June 2025. My bachelor thesis was titled \"Embedded System for Ultrasound Breast Cancer Diagnosis,\" which I built using ResNet-101 and InceptionV3 and deployed on a Raspberry Pi. The project was graded A+. I was also a member of the IEEE Machine Learning Club during my studies.\\n\\nMy technical highlights include Java, Spring, C++, Python, .NET, C#, SQL, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, and Unity.\\n',\n",
